# Mentha Budgeting App

A React and FastAPI-based web application for storing and managing financial
transaction information.

## FITID

Across several schemas in this repository, the field `fitId` or `fit_id` is used
to refer to the related "financial institution tracking id". The assumption is
that this identifying information is unique within the system it is pulled from,
which is general external to this application.
