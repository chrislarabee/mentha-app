# Mentha DB Alembic Migration Env

This area of the api covers configuration of the alembic migration environment
used for managing versions of the database that supports api operations.

## Basic Usage

You can set your dev database to match the structure specified by the alembic
migration scripts by remoting into the api container and running:

```
alembic upgrade head
```

This will create all the necessary tables to match the current database and
domain model schemas. Note that the initialization scripts for the api container
already include a call to `alembic upgrade head`, so you only really need to do this
if you create a new version.

## New Versions

You can create a new version with:

```
alembic revision -m "<short revision description>"
```

And then add the necessary details to the `upgrade` and `downgrade` function
definitions in the resulting file.
